# Rhyme and Rhythm

An 8 week project for ICS 166: Game Design at UCI about designing and marketing for a specific audience.

In the faraway future, all records of music have been wiped from existence due to an undisclosed incident. When time travel is invented, you are sent on a mission to travel back in time and recover all of the music that was lost.

A quasi-8 key rhythm game with story component!
